# Longest Distance First (LDF) Page Replacement Algorithm Explanation

1. The `maxm` function is defined, which takes an array and its size as input. It finds and returns the maximum element in the array.

2. The `distinct` function is defined, which takes an array of pages, the number of pages, the number of frames, a pointer to store a value, and an array to store distinct pages. This function finds the distinct pages from the input array and fills the `dist` array with those distinct pages. It also determines the value of `c5`, which represents the position of the first occurrence of the `n5`th distinct page. The number of distinct pages is returned.

3. The `func` function is defined, which takes the previous frame, the array of distinct pages, a new page, the number of distinct pages, the total number of pages, and a map that stores the index of each distinct page. This function determines the position in the frame where the new page will be inserted in case of a page fault. It calculates the distance between the new page and each page in the frame using modular arithmetic and returns the position with the maximum distance.

4. The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.

   a. The user is prompted to enter the number of frames and the number of inputs (page references).

   b. The user is then prompted to enter the reference pages serially, and the input is stored in the `pages` array.

   c. The `distinct` function is called to find the number of distinct pages. The distinct pages are sorted in ascending order and stored in the `dist` array. A map is created to store the index of each distinct page.

   d. An unordered map called `map` is created to map each distinct page to its index.

   e. Variables `faults` (to count the number of page faults) and a 2D matrix called `matrix` (to represent the frames) are initialized. The matrix is initialized with -1, except for the first column and the last row.

   f. An unordered set called `s` is created to keep track of the pages in the frames.

   g. The algorithm iterates through the page references, starting from the second reference.

      i. The previous column of the matrix is copied to the current column, simulating the movement of pages in the frames.

      ii. If the current page is not present in the set (`s`), indicating a page fault:

         - If the number of page references is less than or equal to `c5`, a new page is inserted into the next available frame. The set `s` is updated accordingly.

         - If the number of page references is greater than `c5`, the `func` function is called to determine the position for the new page. The appropriate page is replaced in the frame, and the set `s` is updated.

         - The page fault count is incremented, and the last element of the matrix is marked as -3 to indicate a page fault.

      iii. If the current page is present in the set `s`, the last element of the matrix is marked as -2 to indicate a page hit.

   h. The matrix is printed, displaying the page references in the frames at each step.

   i. The total number of page faults is printed to console.
